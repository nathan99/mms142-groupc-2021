                        <p>COVID-19 put the world to a standstill. Every major industry has been affected significantly by this “new normal”. Despite this, it seems like AR and VR technologies are growing more than ever. These emerging technologies have been around for quite some time now and have been developing steadily; recently AR and VR technologies have seen a rapid rise, and one of the reasons is that they have become instruments for connection and escapism from our current reality of being locked and isolated.</p>
                        <p>One recent study (Ball et al., 2021) states that during the pandemic, playing games and watching films are the most popular uses of VR. VR and AR technologies have also been transformative in other parts of the entertainment industry and the tourism industry with virtual concerts, virtual theme parks, and virtual art galleries becoming cost-effective solutions. It’s expected that in the next few years, the price to get VR headsets will decrease, thereby making these VR experiences more affordable and accessible to everyone, further disrupting the entertainment and tourism industries.</p>
                        <p>The immersive experience of VR and AR technologies makes them perfect for educational and training applications in various industries too. The application Skyview by Terminal Eleven, for instance, allows students to learn constellations with more fun and ease. Highly technical medical procedures are now also being taught using VR and AR technologies in medical schools. According to Ori Inbar (2020), co-founder and CEO of AugmentedReality.org and the Augmented World Expo, “There’s much higher efficiency and speed with VR training.” In addition, a 2020 study (Sectors disrupted by XR/AR/VR/MR technologies 2020 | Statista, 2020) reports that the healthcare and medical devices sector is expected to be the most disrupted by XR technologies, followed by the Education sector, according to U.S. XR experts.</p>
                        <p>VR and AR technologies have also been used in architecture, construction, and urban planning. By being able to see how their designs look in VR and AR, architects and urban planners can try bolder and more creative ideas and can catch even the tiniest details very early in the design process. They can even see how their design would look in the actual site where it will be built. And on the clients’ side, will there be a better way to be presented with a design than a virtual representation that they can see and walk around in? With these advantages and the projected exponential growth of VR and AR technologies, the architecture, construction, and urban planning industries are prime for evolution in the next few years.</p>
                        <p>In this year’s second-quarter report by GlobalData titled Emerging Technology Sentiment Analysis, the data analytics company (GlobalData UK Ltd, 2021) stated that AR has surpassed artificial intelligence at the top of the list of most disruptive emerging technologies. Hundreds of tech executives responded to the company's regular online survey, which yielded the results.</p>
                        <p>10 years ago, one could only imagine the limitless use-cases of VR and AR technologies. Now, it’s happening. We are in the middle of a disruptive innovation. This is just the beginning stage, and we’ll continue to see more and more industries being disrupted as more and more capital is invested into XR technologies. As reported by Mordor Intelligence (2021), the XR market is expected to reach $463.7 Billion in 2026. Comparing this to its market value of $26.05 Billion in 2020, we see in this projection an 18-fold increase in 6 years!</p>
