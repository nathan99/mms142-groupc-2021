                        <h4>Automotive Industry</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>When we talk about AR, one of the first industries that we think of that revolutionizes their traditional concepts through AR/VR would be the Automotive industry. During the design and prototyping phase, design engineers on some of the known car manufacturers uses 3D glasses so engineers have a clear visualization using a full-size, 360 degree view of the vehicle and view how they will form the exterior and interior designs of a vehicle, and adjust or make changes on the design as necessary. This technology reduces costs of creating a physical prototype. Through the AR/VR technology, they can already fix any issues that a vehicle design may possibly encounter once it is produced.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Social networks</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>VR technology is capable of reconstructing the environment and experience of social networking settings. The uprise presence of the said technology can eventually disrupt the standard in-person interpersonal interactions and even the existence of smartphones which holds the population's access to social media applications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Tourism and travel industry</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>VR can provide traveling experiences without requiring any physical transportations and presence.The disruption is targeted primarily on the transportation industry and the businesses beneath tourism promotion, e.g., food, tour guides, activity accommodations, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Construction and Architecture </h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The role of VR/AR technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction suggest that it provides better understanding, planning, and look at the state and design of the architectural structure. Some use-cases of AR/VR in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sectors specified by the study of Delgado et al. (2020) states stakeholder engagement, design support, design review, construction support, operations and management, and training. The adoption of these technologies disrupts the conventional 2D methods of planning, graphing, and mapping.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="./assets/img/ARinConstructions.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <h4>(Traditional) Education</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The studies and development of VR/AR technologies in one corner of the entirety are aimed at cultivating beyond the traditional education system in the forms of academic materials. Take advantage of smartphones, applications, games, and social networks to facilitate self-learning with heightened engagement, entertainment, and confidence. And create further courses of technology interaction between humans. It disrupts the traditional way of teaching and learning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Healthcare Services</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The healthcare industry/sector was also one of the industries that took advantage of the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality. Through AR/VR, some hospitals and medical institutions use this to easily identify and simulate or show to the medical trainees a near reality sample of body parts without the need to buy an unclaimed cadaver. It increases the speed and pace of learning. It also reduces the cost in the event of any errors during training. </li>
                        <li>Also, I guess most of you are already aware of this. Some hospitals are now using AccuVein which uses AR technology to make it faster and easier for nurses when drawing blood or inserting IVs. Those who already went through this process know how painful it is if the “first strike” didn’t go through to the right vein and the nurse had to repeat the process of inserting the IV needle.</li>
                        <li>In addition to that, the AR/VR experience helps also the patients describe their symptoms or what they feel to the doctors easier. The accuracy of the descriptions through the use of this technology is much higher and it helps the doctors in identifying the best solution to the patient's concerns. One example of this is the use of Ocutrx to help patients with sight/vision problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Business-meetings, training</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>With the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is unfeasible for on-site business meetings and events to be hosted. Therefore, the utilization of online conferencing platforms has been the solution to the dilemma. A study by Pearlman and Gates (2010) has articulated a cognition and acceptance of the future of business meetings and events in virtual reality. And how it will adopt in a few years of their time with its favorable effect at their present. Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook has recently rebranded itself to "Meta." Meta aims to create a virtual world that allows users to "socialize, learn, collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine (Meta, n.d.)." Meta is taking social interactions, meetings, and even entertainment into several steps higher with augmented and virtual reality on hand. This advancement disrupts corporate facilities and events establishments.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Shopping Experience (Retail)</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>We're now reaching the generation where you don't need to go to a physical clothing store just to try and see how a dress or a shirt would look if you wear it! Does it fit just fine? Is it naturally compatible with my skin tone/complexion? Some eCommerce are now in the process of working on making this experience possible. This specifically arises especially when the world was hit by Covid-19 where most retail locations do their best to limit the number of people visiting their stores. I'm not saying this is the exact thing that's happening but the best case for this scenario is the AR app of Nike (Nike Fit) wherein it allows its consumers to measure their feet and provide recommendations of shoes available for the customer.</li>
                        <li>Another example where AR is currently being use is that some large retail stores are now using the technology to help the consumers/buyers to navigate the store. You don't have to go or ask someone from the concierge or any store attendant available about where you can find a specific item. One example who uses AR for in-store navigation is the American home improvement brand Lowe's.</li>
                        <li>Last example I can give is how IKEA also uses an AR app to place or scale furniture to your place with the use of your phone camera. It's like you are already doing a furniture fitting in your house - less the actual furniture and/or measuring.</li>
